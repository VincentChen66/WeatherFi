This is my cs50's final project. cs50 is a Computer Science course (on-campus and online) offered by Harvard University.
cs50 is quite popular among CS courses. My project name is "WeatherFi" where users can search for weather reports of any city around the globe.
WeatherFi also shows the weather reports of top global cities on it's home page.

This project is licensed under MIT license, so there are very few restrictions.
Checkout WeatherFi on AWS: http://weatherfi-env.eba-tmxjgeji.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
Note: The above given website link may change in the future.

Type any city's name on the search bar to get the most precise weather report.
If you input a wrong city-name then it will show you a funny error message.

The website has four different pages:
1. Homepage
2. About me page
3. About this project page
4. Contact me page

# Homepage
This section is the main section of the web application, users can have a look at many of the pre-selected famous cities from the scrollabe cards.
Users can also search for any desired city around the globe. Weather report shows the city's name along with it's country code.
The weather icon changes according to the weather condition. Diiferent sets of icons will be applied for day and night.
WeatherFi has a detailed weather report which shows temperature, feels like, min temperature, max temperature, weather condition in detail, humidity,
and pressure.
